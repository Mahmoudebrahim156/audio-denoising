# Audio Denoising with FFT

A simple project that generates an audio signal with white noise and removes the noise using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).

## Project Files
- `notebook.ipynb` → main Jupyter Notebook  
- `audio_files/white_noise.wav` → audio with noise  
- `audio_files/filtered_audio.wav` → audio after filtering  

## How to Run
1. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter.  
2. Run the cells step by step.  
3. Listen to the audio before and after filtering.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- SciPy  
- Jupyter Notebook
